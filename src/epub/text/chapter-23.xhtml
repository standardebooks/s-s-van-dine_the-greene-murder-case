			<p>Saturday was the District Attorney’s “half-day” at the office, and Markham had invited Vance and me to lunch at the Bankers Club. But when we reached the Criminal Courts Building he was swamped with an accumulation of work, and we had a tray-service meal in his private conference room. Before leaving the house that noon Vance had put several sheets of closely written paper in his pocket, and I surmised⁠—correctly, as it turned out⁠—that they were what he had been working on the night before.</p>
			<p>When lunch was over Vance lay back in his chair languidly and lit a cigarette.</p>
			<p>“Markham old dear,” he said, “I accepted your invitation today for the sole purpose of discussing art. I trust you are in a receptive mood.”</p>
			<p>Markham looked at him with frank annoyance.</p>
			<p>“Damn it, Vance, I’m too confounded busy to be bothered with your irrelevancies. If you feel artistically inclined, take Van here to the Metropolitan Museum. But leave me alone.”</p>
			<p>Vance sighed, and wagged his head reproachfully.</p>
			<p>“There speaks the voice of America! ‘Run along and play with your aesthetic toys if such silly things amuse you; but let me attend to my serious affairs.’ It’s very sad. In the present instance, however, I refuse to run along; and most certainly I shall not browse about that mausoleum of Europe’s rejected corpses, known as the Metropolitan Museum. I say, it’s a wonder you didn’t suggest that I make the rounds of our municipal statuary.”</p>
			<p>“I’d have suggested the Aquarium⁠—”</p>
			<p>“I know. Anything to get rid of me.” Vance adopted an injured tone. “And yet, don’t y’ know, I’m going to sit right here and deliver an edifying lecture on aesthetic composition.”</p>
			<p>“Then don’t talk too loud,” said Markham, rising; “for I’ll be in the next room working.”</p>
			<p>“But my lecture has to do with the Greene case. And really you shouldn’t miss it.”</p>
			<p>Markham paused and turned.</p>
			<p>“Merely one of your wordy prologues, eh?” He sat down again. “Well, if you have any helpful suggestions to make, I’ll listen.”</p>
			<p>Vance smoked a moment.</p>
			<p>“Y’ know, Markham,” he began, assuming a lazy, unemotional air, “there’s a fundamental difference between a good painting and a photograph. I’ll admit many painters appear unaware of this fact; and when color photography is perfected⁠—my word! what a horde of academicians will be thrown out of employment! But none the less there’s a vast chasm between the two; and it’s this technical distinction that’s to be the burden of my lay. How, for instance, does Michelangelo’s <i epub:type="se:name.visual-art.sculpture">Moses</i> differ from a camera study of a patriarchal old man with whiskers and a stone tablet? Wherein lie the points of divergence between Rubens’s <i epub:type="se:name.visual-art.painting">Landscape with Château de Stein</i> and a tourist’s snapshot of a Rhine castle? Why is a Cézanne still-life an improvement on a photograph of a dish of apples? Why have the Renaissance paintings of Madonnas endured for hundreds of years whereas a mere photograph of a mother and child passes into artistic oblivion at the very click of the lens shutter?⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>He held up a silencing hand as Markham was about to speak.</p>
			<p>“I’m not being futile. Bear with me a moment.⁠—The difference between a good painting and a photograph is this: the one is arranged, composed, organized; the other is merely the haphazard impression of a scene, or a segment of realism, just as it exists in nature. In short, the one has form; the other is chaotic. When a true artist paints a picture, d’ ye see, he arranges all the masses and lines to accord with his preconceived idea of composition⁠—that is, he bends everything in the picture to a basic design; and he also eliminates any objects or details that go contr’ry to, or detract from, that design. Thus he achieves a homogeneity of form, so to speak. Every object in the picture is put there for a definite purpose, and is set in a certain position to accord with the underlying structural pattern. There are no irrelevancies, no unrelated details, no detached objects, no arbitr’ry arrangement of values. All the forms and lines are interdependent; every object⁠—indeed, every brush stroke⁠—takes its exact place in the pattern and fulfils a given function. The picture, in fine, is a unity.”</p>
			<p>“Very instructive,” commented Markham, glancing ostentatiously at his watch. “And the Greene case?”</p>
			<p>“Now, a photograph, on the other hand,” pursued Vance, ignoring the interruption, “is devoid of design or even of arrangement in the aesthetic sense. To be sure, a photographer may pose and drape a figure⁠—he may even saw off the limb of a tree that he intends to record on his negative; but it’s quite impossible for him to compose the subject-matter of his picture to accord with a preconceived design, the way a painter does. In a photograph there are always details that have no meaning, variations of light and shade that are harmonically false, textures that create false notes, lines that are discords, masses that are out of place. The camera, d’ ye see, is deucedly forthright⁠—it records whatever is before it, irrespective of art values. The inevitable result is that a photograph lacks organization and unity; its composition is, at best, primitive and obvious. And it is full of irrelevant factors⁠—of objects which have neither meaning nor purpose. There is no uniformity of conception in it. It is haphazard, heterogeneous, aimless, and amorphous⁠—just as is nature.”</p>
			<p>“You needn’t belabor the point.” Markham spoke impatiently. “I have a rudimentary intelligence.⁠—Where is this elaborate truism leading you?”</p>
			<p>Vance gave him an engaging smile.</p>
			<p>“To East 53rd Street. But before we reach our destination permit me another brief amplification.⁠—Quite often a painting of intricate and subtle design does not at once reveal its composition to the spectator. In fact, only the designs of the simpler and more obvious paintings are immediately grasped. Generally the spectator has to study a painting carefully⁠—trace its rhythms, compare its forms, weigh its details, and fit together all its salients⁠—before its underlying design becomes apparent. Many well-organized and perfectly balanced paintings⁠—such as Renoir’s figure-pieces, Matisse’s interiors, Cézanne’s watercolors, Picasso’s still-lives, and Leonardo’s anatomical drawings⁠—may at first appear meaningless from the standpoint of composition; their forms may seem to lack unity and cohesion; their masses and linear values may give the impression of having been arbitrarily put down. And it is only after the spectator has related all their integers and traced all their contrapuntal activities that they take on significance and reveal their creator’s motivating conception.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“Yes, yes,” interrupted Markham. “Paintings and photographs differ; the objects in a painting possess design; the objects in a photograph are without design; one must often study a painting in order to determine the design.⁠—That, I believe, covers the ground you have been wandering over desultorily for the past fifteen minutes.”</p>
			<p>“I was merely trying to imitate the vast deluge of repetitive verbiage found in legal documents,” explained Vance. “I hoped thereby to convey my meaning to your lawyer’s mind.”</p>
			<p>“You succeeded with a vengeance,” snapped Markham. “What follows?”</p>
			<p>Vance became serious again.</p>
			<p>“Markham, we’ve been looking at the various occurrences in the Greene case as though they were the unrelated objects of a photograph. We’ve inspected each fact as it came up; but we have failed to analyze sufficiently its connection with all the other known facts. We’ve regarded this whole affair as though it were a series, or collection, of isolated integers. And we’ve missed the significance of everything because we haven’t yet determined the shape of the basic pattern of which each of these incidents is but a part.⁠—Do you follow me?”</p>
			<p>“My dear fellow!”</p>
			<p>“Very well.⁠—Now, it goes without saying that there is a design at the bottom of this whole amazin’ business. Nothing has happened haphazardly. There has been premeditation behind each act⁠—a subtly and carefully concocted composition, as it were. And everything has emanated from that central shape. Everything has been fashioned by a fundamental structural idea. Therefore, nothing important that has occurred since the first double shooting has been unrelated to the predetermined pattern of the crime. All the aspects and events of the case, taken together, form a unity⁠—a coordinated, interactive whole. In short, the Greene case is a painting, not a photograph. And when we have studied it in that light⁠—when we have determined the interrelationship of all the external factors, and have traced the visual forms to their generating lines⁠—then, Markham, we will know the composition of the picture; we will see the design on which the perverted painter has erected his document’ry material. And once we have discovered the underlying shape of this hideous picture’s pattern, we’ll know its creator.”</p>
			<p>“I see your point,” said Markham slowly. “But how does it help us? We know all the external facts; and they certainly don’t fit into any intelligible conception of a unified whole.”</p>
			<p>“Not yet, perhaps,” agreed Vance. “But that’s because we haven’t gone about it systematically. We’ve done too much investigating and too little thinking. We’ve been sidetracked by what the modern painters call documentation⁠—that is, by the objective appeal of the picture’s recognizable parts. We haven’t sought for the abstract content. We’ve overlooked the ‘significant form’⁠—a loose phrase; but blame Clive Bell for it.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-27" id="noteref-27" epub:type="noteref">27</a></p>
			<p>“And how would you suggest that we set about determining the compositional design of this bloody canvas? We might dub the picture, by the way, <i epub:type="se:name.visual-art.painting">Nepotism Gone Wrong</i>.” By this facetious remark, he was, I knew, attempting to counteract the serious impression the other’s disquisition had made on him; for, though he realized Vance would not have drawn his voluminous parallel without a definite hope of applying it successfully to the problem in hand, he was chary of indulging any expectations lest they result in further disappointments.</p>
			<p>In answer to Markham’s question Vance drew out the sheaf of papers he had brought with him.</p>
			<p>“Last night,” he explained, “I set down briefly and chronologically all the outstanding facts of the Greene case⁠—that is, I noted each important external factor of the ghastly picture we’ve been contemplating for the past few weeks. The principal forms are all here, though I may have left out many details. But I think I have tabulated a sufficient number of items to serve as a working basis.”</p>
			<p>He held out the papers to Markham.</p>
			<p>“The truth lies somewhere in that list. If we could put the facts together⁠—relate them to one another with their correct values⁠—we’d know who was at the bottom of this orgy of crime; for, once we determined the pattern, each of the items would take on a vital significance, and we could read clearly the message they had to tell us.”</p>
			<p>Markham took the summary and, moving his chair nearer to the light, read through it without a word.</p>
			<p>I preserved the original copy of the document; and, of all the records I possess, it was the most important and far-reaching in its effects. Indeed, it was the instrument by means of which the Greene case was solved. Had it not been for this recapitulation, prepared by Vance and later analyzed by him, the famous mass murder at the Greene mansion would doubtless have been relegated to the category of unsolved crimes.</p>

						<li>
							<p>The will of Tobias Greene stipulated that the family must live in the Greene mansion for twenty-five years on pain of disinheritance, with the one exception that, if Ada should marry, she could establish a residence elsewhere, as she was not of the Greene blood.

						<li>
							<p>The library of Tobias Greene, which <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Greene believes she had kept locked for twelve years, contains a remarkably complete collection of books on criminology and allied subjects.</p>

			<p>When Markham had finished reading the summary, he went through it a second time. Then he laid it on the table.</p>
			<p>“Yes, Vance,” he said, “you’ve covered the main points pretty thoroughly. But I can’t see any coherence in them. In fact, they seem only to emphasize the confusion of the case.”</p>
			<p>“And yet, Markham, I’m convinced that they only need rearrangement and interpretation to be perfectly clear. Properly analyzed, they’ll tell us everything we want to know.”</p>
			<p>Markham glanced again through the pages.</p>
			<p>“If it wasn’t for certain items, we could make out a case against several people. But no matter what person in the list we may assume to be guilty, we are at once confronted by a group of contradictory and insurmountable facts. This précis could be used effectively to prove that everyone concerned is innocent.”</p>
			<p>“Superficially it appears that way,” agreed Vance. “But we first must find the generating line of the design, and then relate the subsidi’ry forms of the pattern to it.”</p>
			<p>Markham made a hopeless gesture.</p>
			<p>“If only life were as simple as your aesthetic theories!”</p>
			<p>“It’s dashed simpler,” Vance asserted. “The mere mechanism of a camera can record life; but only a highly developed creative intelligence, with a profound philosophic insight, can produce a work of art.”</p>
			<p>“Can <em>you</em> make any sense⁠—aesthetic or otherwise⁠—out of this?” Markham petulantly tapped the sheets of paper.</p>
			<p>“I can see certain traceries, so to speak⁠—certain suggestions of a pattern; but I’ll admit the main design has thus far eluded me. The fact is, Markham, I have a feeling that some important factor in this case⁠—some balancing line of the pattern, perhaps⁠—is still hidden from us. I don’t say that my résumé is insusceptible of interpretation in its present state; but our task would be greatly simplified if we were in possession of the missing integer.”</p>
			<p>Fifteen minutes later, when we had returned to Markham’s main office, Swacker came in and laid a letter on the desk.</p>
			<p>“There’s a funny one, Chief,” he said.</p>
			<p>Markham took up the letter and read it with a deepening frown. When he had finished, he handed it to Vance. The letterhead read, “Rectory, Third Presbyterian Church, Stamford, Connecticut”; the date was the preceding day; and the signature was that of the Reverend Anthony Seymour. The contents of the letter, written in a small, precise hand, were as follows:</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:letter">
				<header>
					<p epub:type="z3998:recipient">The Honorable John <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">F.-X.</abbr> Markham,</p>
				</header>
				<p><span epub:type="z3998:salutation">Dear Sir:</span> As far as I am aware, I have never betrayed a confidence. But there can arise, I believe, unforeseen circumstances to modify the strictness of one’s adherence to a given promise, and indeed impose upon one a greater duty than that of keeping silent.</p>
				<p>I have read in the papers of the wicked and abominable things that have happened at the Greene residence in New York; and I have therefore come to the conclusion, after much heart-searching and prayer, that it is my bounden duty to put you in possession of a fact which, as the result of a promise, I have kept to myself for over a year. I would not now betray this trust did I not believe that some good might possibly come of it, and that you, my dear sir, would also treat the matter in the most sacred confidence. It may not help you⁠—indeed, I do not see how it can possibly lead to a solution of the terrible curse that has fallen upon the Greene family⁠—but since the fact is connected intimately with one of the members of that family, I will feel better when I have communicated it to you.</p>
				<p>On the night of August 29, of last year, a machine drove up to my door, and a man and a woman asked that I secretly marry them. I may say that I am frequently receiving such requests from runaway couples. This particular couple appeared to be well-bred dependable people, and I concurred with their wishes, giving them my assurances that the ceremony would, as they desired, be kept confidential.</p>
				<p>The names that appeared on the license⁠—which had been secured in New Haven late that afternoon⁠—were Sibella Greene, of New York City, and Arthur Von Blon, also of New York City.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Vance read the letter and handed it back.</p>
			<p>“Really, y’ know, I can’t say that I’m astonished⁠—”</p>
			<p>Suddenly he broke off, his eyes fixed thoughtfully before him. Then he rose nervously and paced up and down.</p>
			<p>“That tears it!” he exclaimed.</p>
			<p>Markham threw him a look of puzzled interrogation.</p>
			<p>“What’s the point?”</p>
			<p>“Don’t you see?” Vance came quickly to the District Attorney’s desk. “My word! That’s the one fact that’s missing from my tabulation.” He then unfolded the last sheet and wrote:</p>
			<blockquote class="summary">
				<ol start="98">
					<li>
						<p>Sibella and Von Blon were secretly married a year ago.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</blockquote>
			<p>“But I don’t see how that helps,” protested Markham.</p>
			<p>“Neither do I at this moment,” Vance replied. “But I’m going to spend this evening in erudite meditation.”</p>
