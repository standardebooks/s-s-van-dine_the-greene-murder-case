			<p>The day after we had taken leave of Markham at his office the rigor of the weather suddenly relaxed. The sun came out, and the thermometer rose nearly thirty degrees. Toward night of the second day, however, a fine, damp snow began to fall, spreading a thin white blanket over the city; but around eleven the skies were again clear.</p>
			<p>I mention these facts because they had a curious bearing on the second crime at the Greene mansion. Footprints again appeared on the front walk; and, as a result of the clinging softness of the snow, the police also found tracks in the lower hall and on the marble stairs.</p>
			<p>Vance had spent Wednesday and Thursday in his library reading desultorily and checking Vollard’s catalogue of Cézanne’s watercolors. The three-volume edition of the “Journal de Eugène Delacroix”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-10" id="noteref-10" epub:type="noteref">10</a> lay on his writing-table; but I noticed that he did not so much as open it. He was restless and distracted, and his long silences at dinner (which we ate together in the living-room before the great log fire) told me only too clearly that something was perturbing him. Moreover, he had sent notes cancelling several social engagements, and had given orders to Currie, his valet and domestic factotum, that he was “out” to callers.</p>
			<p>As he sat sipping his cognac at the end of dinner on Thursday night, his eyes idly tracing the forms in the Renoir <i xml:lang="fr">Beigneuse</i> above the mantel, he gave voice to his thoughts.</p>
			<p>“ ’Pon my word, Van, I can’t shake the atmosphere of that damnable house. Markham is probably right in refusing to take the matter seriously⁠—one can’t very well chivy a bereaved family simply because I’m oversensitive. And yet”⁠—he shook himself slightly⁠—“it’s most annoyin’. Maybe I’m becoming weak and emotional. What if I should suddenly go in for Whistlers and Böcklins! Could you endure it? <i xml:lang="la">Miserere nostri!</i>⁠ ⁠… No, it won’t come to that. But⁠—dash it all!⁠—that Greene murder is haunting my slumbers like a lamia. And the business isn’t over yet. There’s a horrible incompleteness about what’s already occurred.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>It was scarcely eight o’clock on the following morning when Markham brought us the news of the second Greene tragedy. I had risen early, and was having my coffee in the library when Markham came in, brushing past the astonished Currie with only a curt nod.</p>
			<p>“Get Vance out right away⁠—will you, Van Dine?” he began, without even a word of greeting. “Something serious has happened.”</p>
			<p>I hastened to fetch Vance, who grumblingly slipped into a camel’s-hair dressing-gown and came leisurely into the library.</p>
			<p>“My dear Markham!” he reproached the District Attorney. “Why pay your social calls in the middle of the night?”</p>
			<p>“This isn’t a social call,” Markham told him tartly. “Chester Greene has been murdered.”</p>
			<p>“Ah!” Vance rang for Currie, and lighted a cigarette. “Coffee for two and clothes for one,” he ordered, when the man appeared. Then he sank into a chair before the fire and gave Markham a waggish look. “That same unique burglar, I suppose. A perseverin’ lad. Did the family plate disappear this time?”</p>
			<p>Markham gave a mirthless laugh.</p>
			<p>“No, the plate’s intact; and I think we can now eliminate the burglar theory. I’m afraid your premonitions were correct⁠—damn your uncanny faculty!”</p>
			<p>“Pour out your heart-breakin’ story.” Vance, for all his levity, was extraordinarily interested. His moodiness of the past two days had given way to an almost eager alertness.</p>
			<p>“It was Sproot who phoned the news to Headquarters a little before midnight. The operator in the Homicide Bureau caught Heath at home, and the Sergeant was at the Greene house inside of half an hour. He’s there now⁠—phoned me at seven this morning. I told him I’d hurry out, so I didn’t get many details over the wire. All I know is that Chester Greene was fatally shot last night at almost the exact hour that the former shootings occurred⁠—a little after half past eleven.”</p>
			<p>“Was he in his own room at the time?” Vance was pouring the coffee which Currie had brought in.</p>
			<p>“I believe Heath did mention he was found in his bedroom.”</p>
			<p>“Shot from the front?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, through the heart, at very close range.”</p>
			<p>“Very interestin’. A duplication of Julia’s death, as it were.” Vance became reflective. “So the old house has claimed another victim. But why Chester?⁠ ⁠… Who found him, incidentally?”</p>
			<p>“Sibella, I think Heath said. Her room, you remember, is next to Chester’s, and the shot probably roused her. But we’d better be going.”</p>
			<p>“Am I invited?”</p>
			<p>“I wish you would come.” Markham made no effort to hide his desire to have the other accompany him.</p>
			<p>“Oh, I had every intention of doing so, don’t y’ know.” And Vance left the room abruptly to get dressed.</p>
			<p>It took the District Attorney’s car but a few minutes to reach the Greene mansion from Vance’s house in East 38th Street. A patrolman stood guard outside the great iron gates, and a plain-clothes man lounged on the front steps beneath the arched doorway.</p>
			<p>Heath was in the drawing-room talking earnestly to Inspector Moran, who had just arrived; and two men from the Homicide Bureau stood by the window awaiting orders. The house was peculiarly silent: no member of the family was to be seen.</p>
			<p>The Sergeant came forward at once. His usual ruddiness of complexion was gone and his eyes were troubled. He shook hands with Markham, and then gave Vance a look of friendly welcome.</p>
			<p>“You had the right dope, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Vance. Somebody’s ripping things wide open here; and it isn’t swag they’re after.”</p>
			<p>Inspector Moran joined us, and again the handshaking ceremony took place.</p>
			<p>“This case is going to stir things up considerably,” he said. “And we’re in for an unholy scandal if we don’t clean it up quickly.”</p>
			<p>The worried look in Markham’s eyes deepened.</p>
			<p>“The sooner we get to work, then, the better. Are you going to lend a hand, Inspector?”</p>
			<p>“There’s no need, I think,” Moran answered quietly. “I’ll leave the police end entirely with Sergeant Heath; and now that you⁠—and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Vance⁠—are here, I’d be of no use.” He gave Vance a pleasant smile, and made his adieus. “Keep in touch with me, Sergeant, and use all the men you want.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-11" id="noteref-11" epub:type="noteref">11</a></p>
			<p>When he had gone Heath gave us the details of the crime.</p>
			<p>At about half past eleven, after the family and the servants had retired, the shot was fired. Sibella was reading in bed at the time and heard it distinctly. She rose immediately and, after listening for several moments, stole up the servants’ stairs⁠—the entrance to which was but a few feet from her door. She wakened the butler, and the two of them then went to Chester’s room. The door was unlocked, and the lights in the room were burning. Chester Greene was sitting, slightly huddled, in a chair near the desk. Sproot went to him, but saw that he was dead, and immediately left the room, locking the door. He then telephoned to the police and to Doctor Von Blon.</p>
			<p>“I got here before Von Blon did,” Heath explained. “The doctor was out again when the butler phoned, and didn’t get the message till nearly one o’clock. I was damn glad of it, because it gave me a chance to check up on the footprints outside. The minute I turned in at the gate I could see that somebody had come and gone, the same as last time; and I whistled for the man on the beat to guard the entrance until Snitkin arrived. Then I came on in, keeping along the edge of the walk; and the first thing I noticed when the butler opened the door was a little puddle of water on the rug in the hall. Somebody had recently tracked the soft snow in. I found a coupla other puddles in the hall, and there were some wet imprints on the steps leading upstairs. Five minutes later Snitkin gave me the signal from the street, and I put him to work on the footprints outside. The tracks were plain, and Snitkin was able to get some pretty accurate measurements.”</p>
			<p>After Snitkin had been put to work on the footprints, the Sergeant, it seemed, went upstairs to Chester’s room and made an examination. But he found nothing unusual, aside from the murdered man in the chair, and after half an hour descended again to the dining-room, where Sibella and Sproot were waiting. He had just begun his questioning of them when Doctor Von Blon arrived.</p>
			<p>“I took him upstairs,” said Heath, “and he looked at the body. He seemed to want to stick around, but I told him he’d be in the way. So he talked to Miss Greene out in the hall for five or ten minutes, and then left.”</p>
			<p>Shortly after Doctor Von Blon’s departure two other men from the Homicide Bureau arrived, and the next two hours were spent in interrogating the members of the household. But nobody, except Sibella, admitted even hearing the shot. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Greene was not questioned. When Miss Craven, the nurse, who slept on the third floor, was sent in to her, she reported that the old lady was sleeping soundly; and the Sergeant decided not to disturb her. Nor was Ada awakened: according to the nurse, the girl had been asleep since nine o’clock.</p>
			<p>Rex Greene, however, when interviewed, contributed one vague and, as it seemed, contradictory bit of evidence. He had been lying awake, he said, at the time the snowfall ceased, which was a little after eleven. Then, about ten minutes later, he had imagined he heard a faint shuffling noise in the hall and the sound of a door closing softly. He had thought nothing of it, and only recalled it when pressed by Heath. A quarter of an hour afterward he had looked at his watch. It was then twenty-five minutes past eleven; and very soon after that he had fallen asleep.</p>
			<p>“The only queer thing about his story,” commented Heath, “is the time. If he’s telling the tale straight, he heard this noise and the door shutting twenty minutes or so before the shot was fired. And nobody in the house was up at that time. I tried to shake him on the question of the exact hour, but he stuck to it like a leech. I compared his watch with mine, and it was OK. Anyhow, there’s nothing much to the story. The wind mighta blown a door shut, or he mighta heard a noise out in the street and thought it was in the hall.”</p>
			<p>“Nevertheless, Sergeant,” put in Vance, “if I were you I’d file Rex’s story away for future meditation. Somehow it appeals to me.”</p>
			<p>Heath looked up sharply and was about to ask a question; but he changed his mind and said merely: “It’s filed.” Then he finished his report to Markham.</p>
			<p>After interrogating the occupants of the house he had gone back to the Bureau, leaving his men on guard, and set the machinery of his office in operation. He had returned to the Greene mansion early that morning, and was now waiting for the Medical Examiner, the fingerprint experts, and the official photographer. He had given orders for the servants to remain in their quarters, and had instructed Sproot to serve breakfast to all the members of the family in their own rooms.</p>
			<p>“This thing’s going to take work, sir,” he concluded. “And it’s going to be touchy going, too.”</p>
			<p>Markham nodded gravely, and glanced toward Vance, whose eyes were resting moodily on an old oil-painting of Tobias Greene.</p>
			<p>“Does this new development help coordinate any of your former impressions?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“It at least substantiates the feeling I had that this old house reeks with a deadly poison,” Vance replied. “This thing is like a witches’ sabbath.” He gave Markham a humorous smile. “I’m beginning to think your task is going to take on the nature of exorcising devils.”</p>
			<p>Markham grunted.</p>
			<p>“I’ll leave the magic potions to you.⁠ ⁠… Sergeant, suppose we take a look at the body before the Medical Examiner gets here.”</p>
			<p>Heath led the way without a word. When we reached the head of the stairs he took a key from his pocket and unlocked the door of Chester’s room. The electric lights were still burning⁠—sickly yellow disks in the gray daylight which filtered in from the windows above the river.</p>
			<p>The room, long and narrow, contained an anachronistic assortment of furniture. It was a typical man’s apartment, with an air of comfortable untidiness. Newspapers and sports magazines cluttered the table and desk; ashtrays were everywhere; an open cellaret stood in one corner; and a collection of golf-clubs lay on the tapestried Chesterfield. The bed, I noticed, had not been slept in.</p>
			<p>In the centre of the room, beneath an old-fashioned cut-glass chandelier, was a Chippendale “knee-hole” desk, beside which stood a sleepy-hollow chair. It was in this chair that the body of Chester Greene, clad in dressing-gown and slippers, reclined. He was slumped a little forward, the head turned slightly back and resting against the tufted upholstery. The light from the chandelier cast a spectral illumination on his face; and the sight of it laid a spell of horror on me. The eyes, normally prominent, now seemed to be protruding from their sockets in a stare of unutterable amazement; and the sagging chin and flabby parted lips intensified this look of terrified wonder.</p>
			<p>Vance was studying the dead man’s features intently.</p>
			<p>“Would you say, Sergeant,” he asked, without looking up, “that Chester and Julia saw the same thing as they passed from this world?”</p>
			<p>Heath coughed uneasily.</p>

			<p>“Well,” he admitted, “something surprised them, and that’s a fact.”</p>
			<p>“Surprised them! Sergeant, you should thank your Maker that you are not cursed with an imagination. The whole truth of this fiendish business lies in those bulbous eyes and that gaping mouth. Unlike Ada, both Julia and Chester saw the thing that menaced them; and it left them stunned and aghast.”</p>
			<p>“Well, we can’t get any information outa <em>them</em>.” Heath’s practicality as usual was uppermost.</p>
			<p>“Not oral information, certainly. But, as Hamlet put it, murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.”</p>
			<p>“Come, come, Vance. Be tangible.” Markham spoke with acerbity. “What’s in your mind?”</p>
			<p>“ ’Pon my word, I don’t know. It’s too vague.” He leaned over and picked up a small book from the floor just beneath where the dead man’s hand hung over the arm of the chair. “Chester apparently was immersed in literature at the time of his taking off.” He opened the book casually. “<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Hydrotherapy and Constipation</i>. Yes, Chester was just the kind to worry about his colon. Someone probably told him that intestinal stasis interfered with the proper stance. He’s no doubt clearing the asphodel from the Elysian fields at the present moment preparat’ry to laying out a golf-course.”</p>
			<p>He became suddenly serious.</p>
			<p>“You see what this book means, Markham? Chester was sitting here reading when the murderer came in. Yet he did not so much as rise or call out. Furthermore, he let the intruder stand directly in front of him. He did not even lay down his book, but sat back in his chair relaxed. Why? Because the murderer was someone Chester knew⁠—and trusted! And when the gun was suddenly brought forth and pointed at his heart, he was too astounded to move. And in that second of bewilderment and unbelief the trigger was pulled and the bullet entered his heart.”</p>
			<p>Markham nodded slowly, in deep perplexity, and Heath studied the attitude of the dead man more closely.</p>
			<p>“That’s a good theory,” the Sergeant conceded finally. “Yes, he musta let the bird get right on top of him without suspecting anything. Same like Julia did.”</p>
			<p>“Exactly, Sergeant. The two murders constitute a most suggestive parallel.”</p>
			<p>“Still and all, there’s one point you’re overlooking.” Heath’s brow was roughened in a troubled frown. “Chester’s door mighta been unlocked last night, seeing as he hadn’t gone to bed, and so this person coulda walked in without any trouble. But Julia, now, was already undressed and in bed; and she always locked her door at night. Now, how would you say this person with the gun got into Julia’s room, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Vance?”</p>
			<p>“There’s no difficulty about that. Let us say, as a tentative hypothesis, that Julia had disrobed, switched off the lights, and climbed into her queenly bed. Then came a tap on the door⁠—perhaps a tap she recognized. She rose, put on the lights, opened the door, and again repaired to her bed for warmth while she held parley with her visitor. Maybe⁠—who knows?⁠—the visitor sat on the edge of the bed during the call. Then suddenly the visitor produced the revolver and fired, and made a hurried exit, forgetting to switch the lights off. Such a theory⁠—though I don’t insist on the details⁠—would square neatly with my idea regarding Chester’s caller.”</p>
			<p>“It may’ve been like you say,” admitted Heath dubiously. “But why all the hocus-pocus when it came to shooting Ada? That job was done in the dark.”</p>
			<p>“The rationalistic philosophers tell us, Sergeant”⁠—Vance became puckishly pedantic⁠—“that there’s a reason for everything, but that the finite mind is woefully restricted. The altered technic of our elusive culprit when dealing with Ada is one of the things that is obscure. But you’ve touched a vital point. If we could discover the reason for this reversal of our <i xml:lang="fr">inconnu’s</i> homicidal tactics, I believe we’d be a lot forrader in our investigation.”</p>
			<p>Heath made no reply. He stood in the centre of the room running his eye over the various objects and pieces of furniture. Presently he stepped to the clothes-closet, pulled open the door, and turned on a pendant electric light just inside. As he stood gloomily peering at the closet’s contents there was a sound of heavy footsteps in the hall and Snitkin appeared in the open door. Heath turned and, without giving his assistant time to speak, asked gruffly:</p>
			<p>“How did you make out with those footprints?”</p>
			<p>“Got all the dope here.” Snitkin crossed to the Sergeant, and held out a long Manila envelope. “There wasn’t no trouble in checking the measurements and cutting the patterns. But they’re not going to be a hell of a lot of good, I’m thinking. There’s ten million guys more or less in this country who coulda made ’em.”</p>
			<p>Heath had opened the envelope and drawn forth a thin white cardboard pattern which looked like an inner sole of a shoe.</p>
			<p>“It wasn’t no pygmy who made this print,” he remarked.</p>
			<p>“That’s the catch in it,” explained Snitkin. “The size don’t mean nothing much, for it ain’t a shoe-track. Those footprints were made by galoshes, and there’s no telling how much bigger they were than the guy’s foot. They mighta been worn over a shoe anywheres from a size eight to a size ten, and with a width anywheres from an A to a D.”</p>
			<p>Heath nodded with obvious disappointment.</p>
			<p>“You’re sure about ’em being galoshes?” He was reluctant to let what promised to be a valuable clue slip away.</p>
			<p>“You can’t get around it. The rubber tread was distinct in several places, and the shallow, scooped heel stood out plain as day. Anyhow, I got Jerym<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-12" id="noteref-12" epub:type="noteref">12</a> to check up on my findings.”</p>
			<p>Snitkin’s gaze wandered idly to the floor of the clothes-closet.</p>
			<p>“Those are the kind of things that made the tracks.” He pointed to a pair of high arctics which had been thrown carelessly under a boot-shelf. Then he leaned over and picked up one of them. As his eye rested on it he gave a grunt. “This looks like the size, too.” He took the pattern from the Sergeant’s hand and laid it on the sole of the overshoe. It fitted as perfectly as if the two had been cut simultaneously.</p>
			<p>Heath was startled out of his depression.</p>
			<p>“Now, what in hell does that mean!”</p>
			<p>Markham had drawn near.</p>
			<p>“It might indicate, of course, that Chester went out somewhere last night late.”</p>
			<p>“But that don’t make sense, sir,” objected Heath. “If he’d wanted anything at that hour of the night he’d have sent the butler. And, anyway, the shops in this neighborhood were all closed by that time, for the tracks weren’t made till after it had stopped snowing at eleven.”</p>
			<p>“And,” supplemented Snitkin, “you can’t tell by the tracks whether the guy that made ’em left the house and came back, or came to the house and went away, for there wasn’t a single print on top of the other.”</p>
			<p>Vance was standing at the window looking out.</p>
			<p>“That, now, is a most interestin’ point, Sergeant,” he commented. “I’d file it away along with Rex’s story for prayerful consideration.” He sauntered back to the desk and looked at the dead man thoughtfully. “No, Sergeant,” he continued; “I can’t picture Chester donning gumshoes and sneaking out into the night on a mysterious errand. I’m afraid we’ll have to find another explanation for those footprints.”</p>
			<p>“It’s damn funny, just the same, that they should be the exact size of these galoshes.”</p>
			<p>“If,” submitted Markham, “the footprints were not Chester’s, then we’re driven to the assumption that the murderer made them.”</p>
			<p>Vance slowly took out his cigarette-case.</p>
			<p>“Yes,” he agreed, “I think we may safely assume that.”</p>
